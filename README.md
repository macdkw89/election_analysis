# Election Analysis


## Overview of Election Audit
This analysis was to help Colorado Board of Elections employee, Tom, in an election audit of the tabulated results for a US Congressional precinct in Colorado. I am tasked with reporting the following:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

 Tom's Manager wants to automate the process with Python to be used with other types of elections.
